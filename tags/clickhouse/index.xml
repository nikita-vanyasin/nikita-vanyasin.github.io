      <description>ClickHouse is a fast open-source column-oriented database management system that allows generating analytical data reports using SQL queries.
We were using it for some time in our Golang application with the most popular clickhouse-go/v2 driver package which served nice and allowed writing queries in fast and clean way.
Recently I came across the benchmarks for different ClickHouse go drivers comparing the performance for simple select: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ch-bench#benchmarks. I was surprised at the difference between clickhouse-go/v2 and ch-go packages and decided to do a bit of research, especially since I wanted to optimize response times for some of our requests.</description>
